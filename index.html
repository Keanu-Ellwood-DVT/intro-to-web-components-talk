# Not a new idea!
  <img class="dvt-logo" src="assets/img/dvt-logo.png" alt="DVT Logo">
  - The practice of using fron-end code as separate UI components is not new.
    - [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/), [Foundation](https://foundation.zurb.com/), [Semantic UI](https://semantic-ui.com/), [Infragistics](https://www.infragistics.com/), [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/), etc
  - A progress bar "component" in Bootstrap 4

  - A breadcrumb component in Semantic UI

# What are the benefits?
  <img class="dvt-logo" src="assets/img/dvt-logo.png" alt="DVT Logo">
  - Reusable UI functionality in a single application or across multiple applications.
  - We can focus on solving business problems.
  - Great developer experience.
  - More productivity...more partying!

# Can we do better?
  <img class="dvt-logo" src="assets/img/dvt-logo.png" alt="DVT Logo">
  - Bootstrap and friends' way of spliting front-end code into components is great.
  - But...do we not have a more sementic way of expressing our markup code?
  - What if we can go from this:
  ```html5
  <div class="progress">
      <div class="progress-bar w-75" role="progressbar" aria-valuenow="75" aria-valuemin="0" aria-valuemax="100"></div>
  </div>
  ```
  - To this:
  ```html5
  <progress-bar progress="75"></progress-bar>
  ```
  ...and maintain the same behaviour across different browsers and devices.

# What are web components?

  - This is a meta-specification made possible by four other independent specifications:
    - [Custom Elements](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/custom-elements.html)
    - [Shadow DOM](https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#shadow-trees)
    - [HTML Template](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/scripting.html#the-template-element)
    - [ES/JS Module](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/webappapis.html#integration-with-the-javascript-module-system)

# Custom Elements
  <img class="dvt-logo" src="assets/img/dvt-logo.png" alt="DVT Logo">
  - A set of JavaScript APIs that allow you to define custom elements and their behaviour.
  - There are 2 Types of custom elements:
    - Autonomous custom elements:
      - Standalone, they don't inherit from standard HTML elements.
    - Customized built-in elements:
      - Inherit from basic HTML elements.
  - Component behaviour can be managed throught lifecycle callbacks.
  <div style="text-align: center; margin-top: 1em;">

  </div>

# Custom Elements :: Autonomous
  <img class="dvt-logo" src="assets/img/dvt-logo.png" alt="DVT Logo">
  - Defining the component in JS
  ```JavaScript
  // Define the element
  customElements.define('awesome-progress-bar', AwesomeProgressBar);

  // Put some behaviour up in this
  class AwesomeProgressBar extends HTMLElement {

      /**
      * An instance of the element is created or upgraded.
      * Useful for initializing state, settings up event listeners, or creating shadow dom.
      * See the spec for restrictions on what you can do in the constructor.
      */
      constructor() {
        super();

        // Functionality code goes over here
      }
  }
  ```
  - Using the component in HTML
  ```html5
    <awesome-progress-bar progress="75"></awesome-progress-bar>
  ```
---

# Custom Elements :: Customized built-in
  <img class="dvt-logo" src="assets/img/dvt-logo.png" alt="DVT Logo">
  - Defining the component in JS
  ```JavaScript
  // Define the element
  customElements.define('word-count-paragraph', WordCountParagraph, { extends: 'p' });

  // Now...the behaviour
  class WordCountParagraph extends HTMLParagraphElement {
      constructor() {
        super();

        // Some functionality code over here
      }
  }
  ```
  - Using the component in HTML
  ```html5
    <word-count-paragraph>Some awesome text</word-count-paragraph>
  ```
---

# Custom Elements :: Lifecycle Callbacks
  <img class="dvt-logo" src="assets/img/dvt-logo.png" alt="DVT Logo">
  - Special callback functions defined inside the custom element's class definition, which affect its behavior:
    - `connectedCallback()`
      - Called every time the element is inserted into the DOM.
      - Useful for running setup code, such as fetching resources or rendering.
      - Generally, you should try to delay work until this time.
    - `disconnectedCallback()`
      - Called every time the element is removed from the DOM.
      - Useful for running clean up code.
    - `adoptedCallback()`
      -  Invoked each time the custom element is moved to a new document.
      - e.g. someone called `document.adoptNode(el)`
    - `attributeChangedCallback(attrName, oldVal, newVal)`
      - Invoked each time one of the custom element's attributes is added, removed, or changed.
      - Also called for initial values when an element is created by the parser, or upgraded.
      - Which attributes to notice change for is specified in a static get observedAttributes method.

# Shadow DOM
  <img class="dvt-logo" src="assets/img/dvt-logo.png" alt="DVT Logo">
  - The shadow DOM API allows you attach DOM subtrees to elements in a web document.
  - These subtrees are encapsulated; style information inside them cannot apply to outside elements, and vice versa.
    - The DOM (Document Object Model) is a representation of the structure of an html document.
    - The DOM models a document as a tree, with elements in parent-child relationships.
    - On its own, the DOM API contains no support for encapsulation.
      - This makes it hard to develop custom elements as style information may “leak” into or out of other elements in the tree;
      - or IDs may overlap between custom elements and other elements in the document.
---

# Shadow DOM :: Benefits?
  <img class="dvt-logo" src="assets/img/dvt-logo.png" alt="DVT Logo">
  - Isolated DOM:
    - A component's DOM is self-contained.
    - e.g. `document.querySelector()` won't return nodes in the component's shadow DOM.
  - Scoped CSS:
    - CSS defined inside shadow DOM is scoped to it.
    - Style rules don't leak out and page styles don't bleed in.
  - Composition:
    - Design a declarative, markup-based API for your component.
  - Simplifies CSS:
    - Scoped DOM means you can use simple CSS selectors, more generic id/class names, and not worry about naming conflicts.
  - Productivity:
    - Think of apps in chunks of DOM rather than one large (global) page.

# Shadow DOM :: Creating a Shadow DOM
  <img class="dvt-logo" src="assets/img/dvt-logo.png" alt="DVT Logo">
  - In Shadow DOM, use the attachShadow() method to create shadow DOM:
  ```JavaScript
  const header = document.createElement('header');
  const shadowRoot = header.attachShadow({ mode: 'open' });
  shadowRoot.appendChild = '<h1>Hello Shadow DOM</h1>';
  ```
  <div style="text-align: center; margin-top: 2em;">
      <img src="assets/img/tenor.gif">
  </div>
---

# Shadow DOM :: Composition and slots
  <img class="dvt-logo" src="assets/img/dvt-logo.png" alt="DVT Logo">
  - If an element has shadow DOM, the shadow tree is rendered instead of the element's children.
  - For children to render, [slots](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/web-components/shadowdom#slots) can be added to the shadow tree.
  - How?

  ```html5
  <header>
      <h1><slot name="header-text"></slot></h1>
      <button>Menu</button>
  </header>
  ```

  - Add some children by using the component in our HTML:
  ```html5
  <my-header>A really awesome heading!!!</my-header>
  ```

  - The result if we `[View Page Source]`?
  ```html5
  <my-header>
      <header>
        <h1 slot="header-text">Shadow DOM</h1>
        <button>Menu</button>
      </header>
  </my-header>
  ```

# Shadow DOM :: Styling
  <img class="dvt-logo" src="assets/img/dvt-logo.png" alt="DVT Logo">
  - Styles inside a shadow tree are scoped to the shadow tree, and don't affect elements outside the shadow tree.
  - Styles outside the shadow tree also don't match selectors inside the shadow tree.
  - However, inheritable style properties like [`color`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color) still inherit down from <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:host()">:host()</a> to shadow tree.
  <div style="text-align: center; margin-top: 1em;">

# Shadow DOM :: Styling...
  <img class="dvt-logo" src="assets/img/dvt-logo.png" alt="DVT Logo">
  - Component-defined styles
    - This is the `scoped CSS` feature:
      - CSS selectors from the outer document don't apply inside your component.
      - Styles defined inside don't bleed out. They're scoped to the host element.
    - CSS selectors used inside shadow DOM apply locally to your component.
